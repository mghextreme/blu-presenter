    "title": "Why Open Source?",
    "description": "Building a good platform for sheets and presentations is too complex for one person to tackle alone. By making BluPresenter Open Source, we avoid the risks of relying on a single developer and instead allow community collaboration. This approach accelerates development with contributions from developers anywhere, bringing new features and improvements faster than any individual could achieve. Additionally, having many eyes on the code makes it more secure, as the community can quickly identify and fix vulnerabilities that might otherwise go unnoticed."
